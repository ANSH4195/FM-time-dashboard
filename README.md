## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - For styles

### What I learned

I used custom SASS for the first time and loved it. Utilizing mixins, loops and variables, the css code cut down considerably.

### Continued development

I would want to go ahead and create many more projects and practice writing reusable styles and splitting code.
